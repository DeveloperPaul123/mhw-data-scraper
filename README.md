# mhw-data-scraper
A collection of web-scraper scripts for getting MHW data from various wikis/websites.

This is a *very* work in progress project. The main goal of this project is to be able to pull data from Kiranico and other sources/wikis/websites that are not yet available elsewhere for the Iceborne expansion of MHW. 

## Requirements

To run the script you will need:

* Python 3 (tested with `3.8+`)
* Python packages (install with pip if missing)
  * `requests`
  * `bs4`
  * `urllib`
  * `csv`

## Usage

The project includes a number of scrapers that can be used to collect MHW data. Each `.py` file in the project is meant to be run as a stand alone scraper script. Simply open the script you want to use and run it!
